Dear Future Martial Artist, <br />
You may have ended up on this website after searching for some kind of martial arts classes in Miami.
You fall into one or more of these following categories:

<ul>
<li>A parent looking for <strong>martial arts training for children</strong> because you heard that <strong>martial art training is a great way for kids to learn discipline and self-control</strong>.</li>
<li>A "Generation X" or "boomer" adult who's heard that <strong>martial arts is a great way for adults to get into fitness and learn self-defence</strong>.</li>
<li>A "Generation Y" female adult who's looking for <strong>Fitness Kickboxing</strong> because she's learned that <strong>aerobics is dead</strong> so all those <strong>step classes and 45-minute walks on the treadmill are a big waste of time and money.</strong></li>
<li>A "Generation Y" male adult who's looking for something with a <strong>little more substance than the sport martial arts</strong>, something a little more well-rounded.</li>
</ul>

<div class="title">Here' s The Type Of Person 
This Kind Of Martial Art Training Is For</div>

<div class="p"><strong>And, you're NOT looking for the school closest to you</strong>. Nor are you looking for the last "Johnny-come-lately" warehouse school that just opened up claiming to be the best in town!</div>

<img src="jkd/images/sifu.png" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;border: outset gray 2px" width="250" height="310" />

<div class="p">Whatever your category, I welcome you to this website.</div>

<div class="p">As you might imagine, being the Chief Instructor of one of the <strong>most popular and oldest martial arts schools in Miami</strong> (actually one of the oldest Jeet Kune Do schools in the State of Florida), everyday I get lots of phone calls and emails from <strong>people just like you who are looking to start martial arts training</strong>.</div>

<div class="p">Some are <strong>interested in self defense,</strong> others are interested in <strong>fitness and weight loss</strong>, while others are interested in <strong>"mixed martial arts"</strong> fighting.</div>

<div class="p">There's also another group that's attracted to the more esoteric and philosophical aspects of martial arts training.</div>

<div class="p">No matter what your interest, I'm about to make you an <strong>irresistible offer to test-drive some of the best martial arts training</strong> and <strong>the best Jeet Kune Do classes</strong> available in Miami.</div>

<div class="p">In fact, it is literally impossible for you to EVER get a better offer for any type of martial art training you may invest in during your lifetime.</div>

<div class="p">Why?</div>

<div class="p">Because I'm going to let you <strong>try out the martial art program of your choice with zero commitment on your part...</strong> Zero long-term commitment, that is.</div>

<div class="p">Look, I know that getting started at a martial art school can be a scary thing. Actually, starting anything new can be scary... And that's why a lot of advertisers try to trick you into buying their products or services by waving that "no commitment, no obligation" flag in front of you.</div>

<div class="p">But I'm not like that. If you seriously have no interest in making a commitment to yourself or your child, then I have no interest in you.</div>

<div class="p">On the other hand, if you can commit to taking the time to check out our Academy and at least take a "test drive", then go ahead and fill out the information box at the top right or the bottom of this page.</div>

<div class="p">If you've always wanted to know just how martial art training could benefit you and/or your children, then you've come to the right place.</div>

<div class="p">For over 20 years <strong>Unified Martial Art Academy</strong>, the home of <strong>Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do in Miami</strong>, has provided <strong>martial arts lessons for kids and adults</strong> who want to get or stay in shape, learn a discipline, learn self-defense or just engage in a healthful activity, good for their mind, body and soul.</div>

<div class="p">Whether your goals for yourself or your children are to <strong>learn martial arts for self-confidence, discipline, cardiovascular fitness or "mixed martial arts" fighting</strong>, you are sure to find what you want at UMAA.</div>

<div class="title">Here's Why You Want To Listen Very Carefully<br />
To The Things I Have To Say:</div>

<div class="p">Whenever you start out on a new quest, you will always have a lot of questions.</div>

<div class="p">Starting to train in martial arts is no different. In the over 30 years that I've been teaching martial art, including the 20+ years of teaching <strong>Jeet Kune Do here in Miami</strong>, I'm pretty sure I have been asked your question.</div>

<div class="title" style="padding-bottom:0px">Try To See If You Can Find Your Questions Here!</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>I don't have any previous experience, is martial arts training really something I can do?</strong></li>
<li>What exactly is Jeet Kune Do? (or spelling variations like jet kune do, jet kun do, jeet kun do and even jeet kwan do)</li>
<li><strong>Can martial arts training help me to get in shape?</strong></li>
<li>What exactly is Cardio or Fitness Kickboxing?</li>
<li><strong>How soon can I expect to see or feel the benefits?</strong></li>

<li><strong>How long does it take the average person to learn martial arts?</strong></li>
<li>Can you help me find a fitness or martial arts personal trainer?</li>
<li><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></li>
</ul>

<div class="title" style="padding:0px">Did You Find Your Question?  Here Are Some Others You May Or May Not Have Thought About!</div>

<li>Do you have girls' fitness kickboxing classes?</li>

</ul>

<div class="p">Even if you didn't find your question there, I can assure you that whatever your question might be, I've probably been asked it before.</div>

"After a few months of Fitness Kickboxing at UMAA, my health improved so much, my cholesterol levels went down so far that the insurance company lowered my premiums. I owe it all to UMAA. With the money I'm saving on insurance I feel like I'm getting my Kickboxing classes for FREE!"<br /><br />

<div class="comment"><div class="title" style="padding-top:0px">"UMAA introduced me to myself"</div>
"My brother introduced me to UMAA in 1993. It took 2 years before I could join (until I got out of the Army) but after a few weeks with Sifu Dwight, I knew this was what I'd been looking for. UMAA has introduced me to so much... other cultures, people from all walks of life and in a way, to myself."<br /><br />

<br />

<div class="comment"><div class="title" style="padding-top:0px">"My colleagues at UMAA are outstanding teachers and human beings"</div>
"I've been a member of UMAA since November,1992. The first time I saw a group of UMAA students, they were demonstrating at a local gym. I had never seen a martial arts group NOT in karate suits. These guys wore t-shirts with funny looking symbols on them! Cut to 10 years later and I'm the father of 3 beautiful girls; it turns out the gym owners were crooks while my colleagues at UMAA were outstanding teachers and human beings. <br />
At first it was difficult convincing my significant other, but now she knows how important my other (UMAA) family is to me."<br /><br />
<div class="signature">Miguel Hernandez</div></div>

<br />

<div class="comment"><div class="title" style="padding-top:0px">"Classes are empowering, invigorating and encouraging!"</div>
"My office job is mentally challenging but TOO sedentary. I need a physical activity but walking 3 times a week wasn't quite enough. My brother, the Bruce Lee fan, recommended UMAA because he was so impressed with Sifu Dwight's teaching style. I started in Fitness Kickboxing but traveling for work interrupted my classes. Now I'm back taking JKD and I LOVE IT! Sifu Dwight teaches in a relaxed yet deliberate manner, is a man of integrity and a master at his craft. I feel honored to be his student. The UMAA staff has created an environment that is stimulating, courteous, helpful and encouraging. Classes are empowering, invigorating and comfortable. I'm excited to be expanding my horizons in such a great atmosphere." <br /><br />

<div class="comment"><div class="title" style="padding-top:0px">"I chose UMAA to learn effective, practical self-defense methods"</div>
"As a police officer I have to be prepared for the unexpected. Training can mean the difference between life and death. My skills need to be constantly tested and updated. Most of the tactics I was taught were designed with departmental liability in mind. After many confrontations, I knew that I had to find a school where I could learn effective, practical methods. That's why I chose UMAA." <br /><br />

<div class="comment"><div class="title" style="padding-top:0px">"It's an honor to be your student"</div>
Sifu, <br />
For the first time in my life, I feel in control of my own destiny.  Your teachings have given me strength, focus, and I have found that I am the person that I always thought I was, a magnificent human being capable of unimaginable expression.  You have taught me to strive and continue to develop as a martial artist,  friend and a father. <br />
It is a true honor to be your student, and have been shown the way by your example.  
So I salute you, Sifu Dwight Woods, for you continuing support and contribution to my Jeet Kune Do training, my personal development and achievement. <br /><br />

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since 1988 Unified Martial Art Academy has led 
the way in providing the highest levels of training and individual development 
in the martial arts, specifically catering to those Miami-Dade County residents 
who want to use martial art as a vehicle for personal growth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">UMAA's Chief Instructor <i>Sifu</i> Dwight Woods, 
is a martial artist who has  35 years of experience, 34&#189; of which have been 
dedicated to the study and practice of Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sifu Dwight is a native of Trinidad, 
West Indies who grew up on the neighbouring island of Barbados. In 1983, he was the first Caribbean resident 
to attend a California Martial Arts Academy seminar where he met and trained under 
<a href="http://www.inosanto.com/">Dan Inosanto</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cassmagda.com/">Cass Magda</a>, 
<a href="http://www.francisfongacademy.com/">Francis Fong</a>, 
<a href="http://www.fighting.net/">Paul Vunak,</a>
<a href="http://www.jkdassoc.com/">Larry Hartsell</a> and 
<a href="http://www.jkdwednite.com/">Tim Tackett</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you recognise any of those names then you'll 
realise that right from the beginning, Sifu Dwight Woods went straight to the 
top and got his instruction from the very best in Jeet Kune Do.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even if you don't know those names you can 
still appreciate that <span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #FFFF00">as a member/student at Unified Martial Art, you'll receive 
the same top-level instruction</span> that Sifu Dwight received from his teachers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Today the people behind the Ultimate Fighting 
Challenge/Mixed Martial Arts &quot;phenomenon&quot; like to call Bruce Lee the &quot;father of 
mixed martial arts&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's very smart of them to do this because now 
they align themselves with the 20th century's best known martial arts icon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But they are mistaken! Bruce Lee was not 
interested in martial sport competition. Instead, he was more interested in 
martial art as a vehicle for self-development NOT as a means to &quot;ground and 
pound&quot; your opponent into  bloody submission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also Bruce Lee's martial art philosophy goes 
way beyond mere kickboxing and grappling. For example, Bruce Lee always preached 
well-roundedness. Well-roundedness means you must develop ability and skill in 
several complementary areas:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">empty hands</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">weaponry </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">long range</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">middle range</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">close quarters </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">stand-up fighting</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">ground-fighting </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">And lastly, it means development in these 
crucial areas of human development:</span></font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">physical</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">emotional</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">mental</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">intellectual</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">psychological </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">spiritual&nbsp; </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of this and more awaits you as a member of 
Unified Martial Art Academy!</font></p>

Development Path<br>
In Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do</font></b></p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I<b>n 1985</b>, he received his Apprentice Instructor certificate from Inosanto and UMAA was started. At first, UMAA 
operated out of the garage of Dwight's home in Barbados. </font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That "backyard JKD mentality" continued 
<b>in 1986</b> when 
he relocated to Miami, Florida as UMAA moved through a succession of parks, basketball courts, living rooms and 
garages. </font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In April 1988</b>, the first step was taken to provide instruction to a wider clientele with the opening of 
the first "bricks &amp; mortar&quot; Academy in the warehouse district of Tamiami 
Airport. This semi-private/semi-public tradition continued for 4 years as the 
word about JKD was spread through the South Florida area. </font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In 
December 1992</b>, UMAA moved to its first &quot;commercial&quot; location on busy Kendall 
Drive in southwest Miami-Dade county.</font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In 
March 1996</b>, in its second Kendall Drive incarnation, UMAA provides students 
from ages 4 and up with 2400 square feet of state-of-the-art facilities, 
including heavy bag and wooden dummy stations, a pro shop (under construction) 
and separate men's and women's shower and bathroom facilities. </font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There 
are also UMAA affiliate branches in Barbados and Trinidad, where Sifu Dwight 
conducts annual seminars.</font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In 
October 1996</b>, Dwight Woods was awarded the rank of Full Instructor in Jun Fan Gung Fu/Jeet Kune Do and Filipino Martial 
arts by Dan Inosanto. His other instructorship rankings are in Muay Thai under Surachai Sirisute 
as well as teaching diplomas in Boxe Fran√Åaise-Savate 
under Salem Assli and Wing Chun Gung Fu under Francis Fong. </font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dwight has also trained with and been trained by Rick Faye, 
Chris Kent, (the late) Ted Lucaylucay, Jean-Jacques Machado,  Yorinaga Nakamura, Erik Paulson, 
Burton Richardson, (the late) Edgar Sulite and other luminaries in the martial art world.</font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since its first seminar 
<b>in April 1989</b> with Pendekar Paul de Thouars and Burton Richardson, UMAA has afforded martial 
artists the opportunity to train with the world's best. </font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In October 1989</b> Dan Inosanto conducted his first Miami 
seminar and continued to do so for 17 straight years until June 2006.&nbsp; </font></p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p style="margin-top: 4; margin-bottom: 4"><font face="Verdana" size="2">UMAA has also hosted (or co-hosted) seminars 
with Salem Assli, Willem de Thouars, Francis Fong, Samuel Kwok, Jean-Jacques Machado, Cass Magda, Erik Paulson, 
Surachai Sirisute, (the late) Herman Suwanda, Tim Tackett and Paul Vunak.</font></p>

  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">On a historical note, it should be noted that Dan Inosanto's first Florida seminar was hosted in Sarasota in August 
1988 by LaVonne Martin. UMAA members and staff supported this effort just as they did when Richard Bustillo and the 
IMB Academy came to Miami, also in 1988. UMAA members and staff have also attended Miami or Florida seminars with 
Dioniso Ca&ntilde;ete, Dong Cuesta, (the late) Larry Hartsell, Wally Jay, Daniel Lee, (the late) Remy Presas, (the late) Edgar Sulite and Ted Wong</font>.</li>
